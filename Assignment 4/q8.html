      <h2>Understanding Web Technologies</h2>
      <div class="columns">
        <p>
          Web technologies form the foundation of the modern internet. From simple static pages to complex interactive applications, the web has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. The core building blocks of the web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the backend, technologies such as Node.js, PHP, Python (Django/Flask), and Java (Spring) handle business logic and data management. Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL store the information used across applications. Together, these tools form the full stack of modern web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js allow developers to build fast, dynamic user interfaces. These frameworks use virtual DOMs and component-based architectures to create modular, reusable code. With the rise of single-page applications (SPAs), the line between frontend and backend continues to blur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web technologies also include essential protocols and standards. HTTP/HTTPS is the foundation for data exchange, while REST and GraphQL are common patterns for APIs. WebSockets allow real-time communication, making features like live chats and updates possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the continued growth of cloud computing, platforms like AWS, Azure, and Firebase are now essential in deploying scalable, secure applications. DevOps practices such as CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes have become critical for modern development workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, web technologies are constantly evolving, offering developers powerful tools to build, deploy, and scale applications across the globe. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced engineer, staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in web tech is essential.
